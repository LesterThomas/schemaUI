# schemaUI

This NodeJS script generates a HTML User Interface from a set of JSON Schema Files. The UI includes the properties from each entity, inheritance and linked references.

The statis part of the HTML : title, heading, introduction, copywright notice are configurable in a .json config file.

As an example, I have generated a UI from the TM Forum open-API schemas (https://github.com/tmforum-rand/schemas) and the generated HTML can be found at: https://lesterthomas.github.io/schemaUI/
